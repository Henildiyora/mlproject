## Student performance prediction

In the student performance prediction project, I utilized simple machine learning techniques and applied hyperparameter tuning using grid search CV to fine-tune and select the best machine learning model for predicting student performance in examinations. 

For run this code need python environment

For Create a venv 
```
python -m venv <venv_name>
```

For activate venv(macos)
```
source <venv_name>/bin/activate
```

For activate venv(Windows)
```
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```


After creating a virtual environment, run the predict method inside the src/pipeline/predict_pipeline.py file.
